                            I'm so very happy to see that you have decided to stop by and take a little look at my little corner on the internet.

                            If you are here to take a look at my porfolio, then I'd perhaps reccomend taking a gander at it by using the link on the side, or through the nav bar.
                            You certainly won't regret it, or at least I HOPE you won't.
                        </p>
                        <p>As for my other iterests and skills besides web design, I also take great joy in designing levels and maps for various video games.
                            To me, level design is just an awesome thing, as it is a balance between how you present the level itself, along with how the player can interpret those elements,
                            and incorporate these elements into their own play, thus impacting their own overall enjoyment of the final product.
                        </p>
                        <p>Taking this aspect of interest into account, it perhaps should be somewhat obvious that this background in level design that I have, 
                            is perhaps somewhat present in even the web pages that I design, as I always had enjoyed the interactive element of websites, and I feel that interactivity is the key towards 
                            forging excellent user experiences.

            <p>Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well means a
                lot.
                But
                choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.

                How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's
                faster.
                Yeah,
                OK,
                I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You
                don't
                have
                that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.

                I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that
                one.
                See
                that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power.
                More
                pollen,
                more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

                Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He
                finally
                gets
                there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, "Watermelon? I
                thought
                you
                said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?" Is that a bee joke?
