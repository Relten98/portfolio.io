                            Looks like you somehow found me. Excellent work! Though I must say that you are probably
                            not
                            in the right place, as the princess is actually in another castle.
                            I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.If we lived in
                            the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean. I would have to
                            negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
                        </p>
                        <p>As for my personal take on life, I enjoy creating video game stuff, and hopefully my
                            porfolio reflects that aspect as well. Now If only I work faster though... Then I could
                            blast through multiple maps and levels in a day.
                            Now wouldn't that be nice for a change, eh?
                        </p>
                        <p> Ah well, no sense crying over spilled milk though, you like jazz?</p>

                    <p>Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well means a
                        lot.
                        But
                        choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.

                        How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's
                        faster.
                        Yeah,
                        OK,
                        I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You
                        don't
                        have
                        that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.

                        I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that
                        one.
                        See
                        that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power.
                        More
                        pollen,
                        more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

                        Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He
                        finally
                        gets
                        there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, "Watermelon? I
                        thought
                        you
                        said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?" Is that a bee joke?

                        I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that
