                    pop to
                    it. Even if the colors are a little garish at times.

            <p class="card-text">A project that was made in conjuction with a small group. This application takes a song
                that the user can input, using artist name and song name, and generate a set of lyrics, along with
                translating them into a few other languages.
                I was the individual in charge of setting up the overall look of the page, which was an undertaking in
                its own right, with so many changes being placed on it throughout the development process.
                In hindsight, perhaps the website could have gone with a little bit more of a professional tone. As the
                garish colors really don't look all that great all things considered, even if it was my first REAL
                attempt at diving into css, and html coding.

            <p class="card-text">Another project that was made in conjuction with a small group. This application in
                particular is supposed to be a sort of database in which users can submit links to tutorial videos and
                articles,
                along with vote on other tutorials. Getting the database was perhaps one of the hardest aspects behind
                the project, aside from perhaps a bit of communication between the back-end, and front end team, leading
                to an unfortunate amount of wasted time.
                In the end, the project turned out alright, however it did end up missing a lot of features that we
                wanted to implement when we initially created it, which was a bit of a dissapointment.
            </p>
            <p>Should we continue to improve on the project, it would perhaps be in our best interests to make sure we
                link proper articles, along with including a bonafide authentication system to check if the article is a
                legitamate article, along with check if the user had already voted.
                Additionally, it would certainly be an improvement if users were allowed to log in, but all of these
                features depends if the rest of the group is willing to continue work on the project.
            </p>
            <p>My main contributions for this particular application, was helping with getting the databases set up,
                though I will admit that towards the end, I ended up being the guy responsible for also properly
                deploying the application as well.
                I'm also responsible for home page's look, so at least we get some style points for the base looks.
                If it were up to be, we would have continued with the darker color style throughout the entire website,
                as bright colors burn my retinas.

    <p>Believe it or not, I'm actually quite the budding level designer, so I thought I'd also share a fair bit of my
        work in this aspect as well, since it showcases what I am capable of in terms of design.</p>
    <p>For those whom it may concern, a majority of these maps had been constructed for "Quake", and you can easily find
        links to most of my works below for free on Quaddicted, with the exception of my work for Graven. You have to
        pay 3D Realms for that one.</p>
    <p>Below, I have included a collection of some of the mapping projects I have participated in, and whenever
        possible, I have also included a link for you to check it out, in case you are curious about it. </p>

                    <p class="card-text">This is the exterior of my first map, and it was built over the course of
                        perhaps four to five months. Drawing heavy inspiration from the temples found in Abu Simbel,
                        This map boasts tremendious egyptian scale to create a formidable fascade that serves as an
                        imposing introduction to the map for the player, giving them a sense of overall location.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had selected the egyptian style of design, as I've always held a sort of love for ancient
                        egyptian culture, hailing from my obsession with egyptian themed pulp stories written and or
                        set in the 1920s and 1930s.
                        These types of stories always held a sort of sense of raw exploration that I just couldn't
                        get enough of, so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that these influences are starting
                        to show up in my work, well into adulthood.

                    <p>
                        The second image is the interior of the great tomb that serves as the focal point for the map.
                        Unlike the
                        exterior, which drew heavily inspiration from an actual egyptian monument in Abu Simbel, the
                        interior is
                        more of a fantasy interpretation of it.
                        Despite not being based on anything "real", it is using design techniques and architectural
                        flourishes that are found within ancient egyptian architecture, such as the iconic
                        antichamber. Along with the tomb of the supposed Pharoah whom this tomb was allegedly built
                        for, which delighted the many players who had played this,
                        as the walls made of solid gold, illuminated by the faint glow of the torches gave it an
                        overall illusitrious look that made players feel like they had found a true treasure trove.

                            This map is by far one of my favorites to make, as it has a serious amount of verticality,
                            along with the fake 3d background that really gives it a sense of scale.

                            mapping jam back in 2019, but unfortunately ran into shortages on personal time, and had to
                            set the project aside.
                        </p>
                        <p>Perhaps one day, I'll finish it, as it is somewhat close to being finished. Though if I do, I
                            am certainly going to complete it without the imposed limitations of being a certain size,
                            like how the initial mapping jam had imposed.</p>

                            I'd love to add more to it some day, but since it is no where near being completed, I'll

                <p class="card-text">This is my submission for the 2019, annual Halloween jam for Quake 1. While not the
                    most varied in terms of encounters, the reception for it has been overall quite positive. </p>
                <p>The map itself is an old farm house set sometime in the early 20th century, with the central theme
                    built around the player investigating it, in order to find a phone following a car crash.</p>
                <p>Naturally, things to not go entirely to plan, as spooky shenanagins toss a wrench into the works,
                    forcing the player to deal with all sorts of unpleasant monstrosities along the way.</p>
                <p>In terms of design for this map, the layout is honestly quite simple and open ended. The player can
                    accomplish any of the significant tasks in any order that they'd like,
                    however the difficult does favor a particular way of going about it, which I wanted to address and
                    ultimately fix in a potential remaster of this map.
                    as far as most things are concerned however, this map was quite a popular one in the jam, and many
                    folks appreciated both the amount of detailing present in it, along with the many nods to various
                    horror movies found within it.

            <h2>Malice Maps</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Technically speaking, Malice IS Quake, as it was effectively nothing more than a total conversion mod for
                quake, including the necessity of needing to own quake to even run it.</p>
            <p>However, despite this, Malice had been sold as a stand alone product despite this, and coupled with the
                fact that it is rather different from what is considered "base" Quake, I have included Malice into a
                category of its own.</p>

                        eachother in this rather tightly designed map.
                        Looking back at it, I definitely should have spread out the weapons and items a bit more, or
                        at the very least, should have made the better items a tad harder to aquire,
                        as it is a tad too easy for one player to deny the other from getting them.

                <p class="card-text">A Malice map set inside of a cyberpunk themed nightclub. I'm sort of
                    popular for this map I guess, as this was the map that introduced Malice to a large portion
                    of quake player, since it was the only modern map constructed for malice when it was
                    released.
                    I had selected Malice specifically for the reason that it just wasn't getting any love from
                    other mappers, and was commonly dismissed as "having poor level design", therefore leading
                    me to wonder what a malice map would look and play like, when it is using modern mapping
                    techniques. The end result was overall quite well receieved, despite the minor bugs found in
                    the nearly 22 year old mod that is running it.
