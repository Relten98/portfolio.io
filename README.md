# portfolio.io

This is three included html files, that should be fairly resposive, albeit a tad buggy due to my inexperience.

===========================================

Was quite proud of getting the timed image carousel in the portfolio page with working captions to work properly, and even had it so that it is also somewhat responsive. The images below it is a little bit of a different story, however.

Start page is probably not the most impressive, however, as I was struggling with the CSS to get it somewhat proper looking. It isn't as snazzy as I would like for it to be, but it is servicable at the very least.

============================================

I had also ran a quick validity check for the html. everything should also be good, barring a couple of body tags that aren't quite linking up for some reason, and I cannot pinpoint precisely WHY that is the case.

Along with that, all images have alternative text, and the website auto scales depending the the viewport's size.


=============================

Attached within the Repo are a few screenshots showcasing the website just in case one doesn't want to view the website itself for whatever reason.
