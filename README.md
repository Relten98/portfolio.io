# portfolio.io

This is three included html files, that should be fairly resposive, albeit a tad buggy due to my inexperience.

Was quite proud of getting the timed image carousel in the portfolio page with working captions to work properly, and even had it so that it is also somewhat responsive. The images below it is a little bit of a different story, however.
